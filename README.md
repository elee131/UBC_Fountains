# UBC Fountain Map

## *stay hydrated!*

This application will pinpoint water fountains around UBC Vancouver campus.
These features will appear as a pin on a map, which users would be able to click on to gather more
specific information. They will be able to select favourite pins to add to a collection. 
Users will also be able to create new pins on the map to mark any place on campus
of their choice.

Each pin would these key information:
- a tag describing the pin
- a picture
- UBC building code/general location in case of user-pins
- directions from the entrance of the building (not for all pins) 


Should the user choose to add a pin, they **do not** have to enter every information listed above.

This map is not an exhaustive list of all fountains around campus. Please add more as you discover them!
