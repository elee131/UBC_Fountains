# UBC Fountain Map

## *stay hydrated!*

This application will pinpoint water fountains around UBC Vancouver campus.
These features will appear as a pin on a map, which users would be able to click on to gather more
specific information. They will be able to select favourite pins to add to a collection. 
Users will also be able to create new pins on the map to mark any place on campus
of their choice.

Each selected pins would have information such as:
- a picture
- general location
- directions from the entrance of the building

Should the user choose to add a pin, they would be able to add the **same information** as well.

Finding a spot to fill water bottles or drink water without paying for a water bottle on campus is 
too hard. I remember buying a few bottles of water in my first year since I could
not find any fountains around. Even now, as a student who is more familiar with campus, 
finding a water fountain is a daunting task in certain buildings. Therefore, I decided to make a map of easily
accesible fountains around campus, and allow users to add pins to notate other features such as
microwaves or favourite study spots.

I hope this application will be of use to the students of UBC.
